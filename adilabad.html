                        Sahastrakund Waterfall is an amazing waterfall on the Penganga River, a tributary to Godavari River at Murli village. The water falls can be visited throughout the year, though monsoon is the best season. The water drops from a height of 50 feet to form the breathtaking waterfalls. The rock pattern in surroundings of the falls is also interesting, as the black rock appears like a metal. The water force is quite high during monsoons and not advised to get into the water.

                        There are two temples near the falls on both sides of the river. A long ramp was constructed to have good views of the waterfalls. There is a watch tower nearby that gives breathtaking views of the waterfall.
                        From Nirmal, the waterfall can be reached via Dhani, Swarna & Islahpur. The road from Nirmal is average and can get worse during heavy rains. Public transportation is limited to this place from Nirmal (one bus that runs four times a day). There is also a railway station (Sahastrakund Railway Station) which is half km from Islahpur and 5 km from the waterfall. This station is connected with Hyderabad, Nagpur, Nanded and Adilabad.
